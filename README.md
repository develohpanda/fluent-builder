### Generate a fluent, typed object builder for any interface or type.

`fluent-builder` consumes a seeding schema, and generates a builder with a signature identical to the type being built, but with `mutate` functions, to make iterative modifications to your object. The builder contains two additional properties, `reset()` and `build()`.

```ts
createBuilder<Product>(schema).name('Shirt').price(42).build();
```

## Why?

`fluent-builder` aims to simplify the use of the [builder pattern](https://sourcemaking.com/design_patterns/builder) for Typescript, using generics. This pattern allows for iterative construction of complex, often nested objects. Typically, a unique builder class needs to be implemented for each unique interface or type, to ensure correct typing is available.

## Installation

The usual

```
yarn add -D @develohpanda/fluent-builder

npm i --save-dev @develohpanda/fluent-builder
```

### Gotcha!

In order for types to be detected correctly in VS Code (eg. IntelliSense on hover), any file using `fluent-builder` should be included in the default project `tsconfig` to be compiled. If you know how to fix this, please submit a PR! :)

## Usage

#### Define your interface / type
```ts
interface Product {
  name: string;
  price: number;
  color?: string;
  buy: () => void;
}
```

#### Define a schema

```ts
import {Schema} from '@develohpanda/fluent-builder';

const buyMock = jest.fn();

const schema: Schema<Product> = {
  name: () => 'Shirt',
  price: () => 2),
  color: () => undefined,
  buy: () => buyMock,
}
```

#### Create a builder
```ts
import {createBuilder} from '@develohpanda/fluent-builder';

const builder = createBuilder(schema);
```

#### Consume
```ts
describe('suite', () => {
  beforeEach(() => builder.reset());

  it('test', () => {
    const mock = jest.fn();
    const instance = builder.price(4).buy(mock).build();

    // use instance and mock
  });
});
```

The overhead of constructing a new builder can be avoided by using the `builder.reset()` method. This resets the mutated schema back to its original, and can be chained.

```ts
builder.reset().price(5).build();
```
